This is the file tree needed for the display board firmware for the APRS board described on https://www.qrz.com/db/la1pca

The board schematic diagram and PCB layout in KiCad format is in a separate repo.

The build environment is Microchip MPLAB X IDE v5.50, Harmony v2.06, xc32 v2.41, and xc8 v2.36.

You will probably be able to build just fine with any updated Microchip toolchain and compiler versions. However, the Harmony framework 
needs to be version 2.x, not the newer v3 which is a whole different thing (don't get me started :-)  )
